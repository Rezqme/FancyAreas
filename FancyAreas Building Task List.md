   - Keyboard-only layout management
   - Keyboard shortcuts for all major functions
   - Alternative to mouse-based snapping (keyboard commands)

5. Zone numbers:
   - Always visible option (for low vision users)
   - High contrast mode
   - Larger text option
```

### Task 30: Testing & Quality Assurance
```
Create comprehensive test suite:
1. Unit tests for:
   - Data models (encoding/decoding)
   - File management (save/load/delete)
   - Zone calculations
   - Monitor configuration comparison
   - Keyboard shortcut handling

2. Integration tests for:
   - Layout activation flow
   - App restoration process
   - Zone snapping behavior
   - Multi-monitor handling
   - iCloud sync operations

3. UI tests for:
   - Menu bar interactions
   - Layout management window
   - Zone editor workflows
   - Preferences changes
   - Error dialog handling

4. Manual testing checklist:
   - Test on Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
   - Test on different macOS versions (11.0+)
   - Test with various monitor configurations
   - Test with common apps (Safari, Finder, etc.)
   - Test permission request flows
   - Test with iCloud enabled/disabled
   - Test 10 layout limit enforcement
   - Test all keyboard shortcuts
   - Test with VoiceOver enabled
   - Test with Reduce Motion enabled

5. Edge cases:
   - Very large displays (5K, 6K)
   - Very small displays
   - Different aspect ratios
   - Display rotation
   - Apps with minimum window sizes
   - Apps that resist resizing
   - Corrupted layout files
   - Full disk scenarios
   - Network interruptions (iCloud sync)
```
