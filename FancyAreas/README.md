# FancyAreas - macOS Window Management Application

A powerful macOS window management application built with Swift and SwiftUI that enables zone-based window snapping and layout management.

## Features

- **Zone-Based Window Snapping**: Define custom zones on your displays and snap windows to them with keyboard modifiers
- **Layout Management**: Save up to 10 different zone layouts and switch between them instantly
- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Configure independent zones for each display
- **Application Restoration**: Save not just zones, but which apps go in which zones
- **iCloud Sync**: Sync your layouts and preferences across all your Macs
- **Menu Bar Integration**: Quick access to all layouts from the menu bar
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Fast layout switching with customizable shortcuts

## System Requirements

- macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) or later
- Apple Silicon or Intel processor (Universal Binary)
- Accessibility permission (for window management)
- Screen Recording permission (for overlay display)

## Building

This project uses Swift Package Manager:

```bash
swift build
swift run
```

For Xcode:
```bash
open Package.swift
```

## Permissions Setup

FancyAreas requires the following permissions:

1. **Accessibility**: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility
2. **Screen Recording**: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Screen Recording
3. **Automation**: Granted automatically when controlling specific applications

## Architecture

### Core Components

**Models** (`FancyAreas/Models/`)
- Data structures with Codable support
- Layout, Zone, Display, AssignedApp, GridSettings
- Full JSON serialization/deserialization

**Controllers** (`FancyAreas/Controllers/`)
- `PermissionsManager`: System permission handling
- `MenuBarController`: Menu bar UI and layout switching
- `ZoneManager`: Zone detection and spatial indexing

**Utilities** (`FancyAreas/Utilities/`)
- `LayoutFileManager`: File I/O and storage management
- `LaunchOnLoginManager`: System startup integration

**Views** (`FancyAreas/Views/`)
- `FirstRunSetupView`: Permission setup wizard (SwiftUI)

### Performance Optimizations

- **Spatial Grid**: O(1) zone detection using 100px grid cells
- **Zone Cache**: Pre-indexed zones by display ID
- **Lazy Loading**: Layout previews loaded on demand
- **Memory Efficient**: Minimal overhead for zone tracking

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Models, file management, zone detection
- **Integration Tests**: File operations, permission workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Zone detection benchmarks (1000 lookups)
- **Coverage**: Core functionality fully tested

## Next Steps

1. Implement window drag monitoring with CGEventTap
2. Create zone overlay visualization system
3. Build window snapping engine with Accessibility API
4. Design and implement preferences window
5. Create layout management and zone editor UIs
